# A end-to-end data science project

![](https://i.imgur.com/pCcIwtu.png)
Data science is an area that is commonly described as the intersection of statistics/mathematics, computing and knowledge about the domain of the problem to be solved.
Therefore, one of the most interesting ways to have a first contact with the area or to develop a project to put in the personal portfolio is to work with the so-called end-to-end solutions, which cover from the first stages of the pipeline to the final one. 
￼

So, my name is Wesley Alves and in this kernel, we will take a tour and discuss concepts of the three areas that make up data science and we will also cover the entire pipeline of tasks that are usually carried out in the daily life of a professional.


There are several problems that could serve as a basis for building this project. Here, a special was chosen, to take a look, imagine that the CEO of your company come and tell to you the following:


> "Hey, I was traveling on the web and find a kind of "brazilian SAT", called ENEM. After read more about it, I was wondering if we can take some insights of the data provided by the test organizers and and perhaps create some solution that will help the students to plan which colleges they want to apply to before they even have the official score. What do you think?"


As a person who had long sought an opportunity to explore this area of data and analytics, you accept the "challenge" and decide first to try to better understand the problem. So, let's go!
